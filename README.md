This library allows discovering Midea air conditioners and dehumidifiers on local network, getting their state and controlling then. The name comes from Chinese name for Midea (美的) which translates to _beautiful_ in English.

This library inspired from the repository at [mac-zhou/midea-msmart](https://github.com/mac-zhou/midea-msmart) which provides similar functionality for air conditioners and [barban-dev/midea_inventor_dehumidifier](https://github.com/barban-dev/midea_inventor_dehumidifier) cloud based functionality for dehumidifiers. This library may include verbatim or adapted portions of the code from those two projects.

## Supported appliances

The library works with Midea air conditioners and dehumidifiers supporting V2 and V3 protocol.

Some examples of supported dehumidifiers:

* Comfee MDDF-16DEN7-WF or MDDF-20DEN7-WF (tested with 20L version)
* Inventor EVA ΙΟΝ Pro Wi-Fi (EP3-WiFi 16L/20L) (tested with 20L version)
* Inventor Eva II Pro Wi-Fi (EVP-WF16L/20L)
* Pro Breeze 30L Smart Dehumidifier with Wifi / App Control
* Midea SmartDry dehumidifiers (22, 35, 50 pint models )
* Midea Cube dehumidifiers (20, 35, 50 pint models)

It may as well work with other Midea Wi-Fi air conditioners and dehumidifiers.

## Discovery

This library is able to discover appliances on local network. This is done by broadcasting UDP packets to port 6445. Appliances will respond to this broadcast with their description packet. Following discovery, communication switches to TCP over port 6444. This communication is encrypted, and, for appliances with version 3 firmware the library needs a token/key (K1) combination associated to each appliance. This can be either provided as arguments or retrieved from Midea app account. Once obtained, the token/key (K1) pair can be reused for an appliance multiple times. The library can also retrieve the list of registered appliances from Midea app account and obtain additional information for devices (eg. name).

Library connects to Midea cloud API using credentials from NetHome Plus mobile app. You can use other Midea app mobile applications if you obtain their application key and id. See [midea_beautiful/midea.py](midea_beautiful/midea.py) for some examples. Application key and application id must match, otherwise library won't be able to sign in.

The discovery should work on Linux and Windows based systems, however as of 2022 it doesn't work in Windows Subsystem for Linux and may not work in Docker containers or VMs as it depends network capabilities. For example, a VM or a container needs to have rights to broadcast to physical network to make discovery work. One workaround, if physical network access is not possible, is to run discovery from non-virtualized environment host.

If this discovery mechanism doesn't work on particular set-up, it is still possible to either target appliances directly using their IP address, when it is known, or to retrieve or set their status using cloud service.

### Network considerations

Discovery requires that both the appliance and the machine performing discovery are on the same broadcast subnet. By default library issues broadcast to all network, i.e. address `255.255.255.255`, but it is possible to restrict broadcast subnet (e.g. 192.0.2.255)

## Local protocol support

Library supports following protocols:

* cloud based status reading and writing (no local access needed)
* v3 local protocol with compatible devices (requires TOKEN/KEY combination)
* v2 local protocol with compatible devices

## Logging

Credentials information like username, password or token keys are redacted by default. When using command line, pass `--no-redact` option to show them in the logs. You can use command line tool to display token and key (K1) data.


## Command Line Usage

### Installing package

* The library requires Python 3.8 or later. Current version is tested with Python 3.11.

```shell
pip install --upgrade midea-beautiful-air
```

### Discovery

Discover appliances on the local network:

```shell
midea-beautiful-air-cli discover --account ACCOUNT_EMAIL --password PASSWORD
```

Show tokens used to connect to appliances via local network

```

Get status of an appliance using Midea app credentials

```shell
midea-beautiful-air-cli status --ip APPLIANCE_IP_ADDRESS --account ACCOUNT_EMAIL --password PASSWORD

```
Set `WARNING` level (default log level if option was not specified)
```shell
midea-beautiful-air-cli --log WARNING discover --account ACCOUNT_EMAIL --password PASSWORD
```

Additional logging is enabled by passing `--verbose` option. Redacting of sensitive information can be disabled by passing `--no-redact` option.

## Code examples

Discover appliances on local network:

```python
from midea_beautiful import find_appliances


appliances = find_appliances(
    account="USER_EMAIL@example.com",  # Account e-mail
    password="secret_password",  # Account password
)
for appliance in appliances:
    print(f"{appliance!r}")
```

Get appliance state:

```python
from midea_beautiful import appliance_state

appliance = appliance_state(
    address=192.0.2.2,  # APPLIANCE_IP_ADDRESS
    token="TOKEN",  # TOKEN obtained from Midea API
    key="KEY",  # Token KEY obtained from Midea API
)
print(f"{appliance!r}")
```


Get appliance state from cloud:

```python
from midea_beautiful import appliance_state, connect_to_cloud


cloud = connect_to_cloud(
            account="USER_EMAIL@example.com",  # Account e-mail
            password="secret_password",  # Account password
            appname="MSmartHome"
        )

appliance = appliance_state(
    cloud=cloud,  # Account e-mail
    id=appliance_id,  # Appliance id obtained from Midea API
)
print(f"{appliance!r}")
```

## Build the library

Library is automatically built, packaged and published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/midea-beautiful-air/) when a Git Hub release is published.

## Known issues

* Some of values are not available on all appliances. Some appliances may acknowledge action which has no effect (e.g. ion mode)
* Temperature sensor is often under-reporting real ambient temperature. This may be due to sensor proximity to cooling pipes of the humidifier, algorithm or electronics error. The under-reporting depends on the active mode, and stronger modes may result in larger offset from real temperature.
